# API Study Archive

## Overview

This repository serves as a collection of various API projects for study and reference purposes. Each project in this repository is a self-contained example of a specific type of API or demonstrates a particular aspect of API development.

The projects range from simple APIs with a single endpoint to more complex APIs that include features like database integration, authentication, rate limiting, and more.
